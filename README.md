 #                                     Stockmarket Close price Prediction using Stacked LSTM

Long_Short_Term_Memory (LSTM)

LSTM is an artificial recurrent neural network, one of the popular approaches for Stockmarket Prediction. The reason they are popular is their ability to store long-term data.

Aside from LSTM, ARIMA is a trendy model for Time Series Forecasting.

Implementation Steps:
1. Import the Required Libraries
2. Read the CSV file
3. Preprocess the data
4. Split the data (train & test)
5. LSTM model (build, compile & fit)
6. Predict the prices for test data
7. Visualize the Predicted prices 

For better understanding, I have also uploaded the jupyter Notebook.
